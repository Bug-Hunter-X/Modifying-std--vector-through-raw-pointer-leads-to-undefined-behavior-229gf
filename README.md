This repository demonstrates a common error in C++ when working with std::vector and raw pointers. Modifying a vector's elements through a raw pointer obtained from `&vec[0]` can lead to undefined behavior if the vector's internal storage is reallocated.  The `bug.cpp` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.cpp` provides a safer alternative using iterators or at-index access.
